We did so by considering the movement of agents that aim to reduce a cost function that is dependent on various factors, including number of amenities, upkeep, and other factors.</p>"},{"location":"24fa-mponc/#the-four-step-model","title":"The Four-Step Model","text":"<p>Given that the agents move across various subregions of the Atlanta area in our simulation, one of the critical steps of the simulation is figuring out what subregion the agents go to. To do this in a way that accurately represents real-world distributions, we turned to the four-step model, a common trip generation algorithm: </p> <p></p> <p>The model has four components:</p> <ol> <li>Trip Generation: This part of the model estimates the number of trips originating from or destined for a specific area. It focuses on understanding how many trips are generated rather than specific travel patterns. This process usually involves some type of data pertaining to the area at hand, such as demographics, income, or land usage.</li> <li>Trip Distribution; This part of the model estimates the number of trips for routes that go from an area to another, as determined in the trip generation step. This process is typically done using the gravity model, which assumes that the number of trips are positively correlated with the attractiveness of an area and inversely correlated to distance.</li> <li>Mode Choice: This part of the model determines the mode of transporation used to make the trips. This is typically done by considering demographic data (such as the percentage of people with cars) in an area.</li> <li>Route Assignment: This part of the model determines the routes travelers take between origins and destinations. This is typically done by considering the route that takes the shorted possible time, and following that. </li> </ol> <p>Our approach closely follows these four components. We first generate trips by considering the amenity density of areas. We sum up all amenity densities, and divide each area's density by this sum to generate a probability. We then utilize a Poisson Distribution to generate the number of trips by multipling a base number of trips by the probability. We then consider trip distribution through a modified gravity model. The equation for our model is the following, given that we aim to go from area/region i to j:</p> <p></p> <p>We essentially multiply the total number of trips from area i to area j with the net amenity score for the destination j times transportation cost for that specific trip from area i to j, divided by the net amenity score for area j times the transportation cost from area i to j summed up over all destination j's. </p> <p>For our modal split, we assume that the car ownership rate is 0.7, and that the transit rate is 0.3. Each region's trips are split based on this. We then assign these routes based on the shortest possible distance.</p> <p>Through this process, we were able to have a methodical way of distributing the agents across Atlanta based on area factors such as amenity density.</p>"},{"location":"24fa-mponc/#census-based-approach","title":"Census-based approach","text":"<p>A key part of our approach is that it utilizes data from the US census; namely, the graphical regions our agents inhabit correspond directly to US census tracts. Consequently, our simulation produces economic and population data for individual census tracts, which we can then compare to live census data. Since the US Census TIGER/Line Geodatabases contain publicly downloadable shapefiles of all the geographic regions it reports on, our simulation can likewise operate with any other census-reported region, not just census tracts, including zip codes, housing districts, school districts, etc. </p> <p>Additionally, each 'agent' has a unique wealth attribute as one of the factors influencing decision-making. Instead of assigning these wealths arbitrarily, we create this distribution of wealth using census population and median income data, so that our agents are representative of actual Fultona and Dekalb county resident demographics. Namely, we use the following tables from the Census website: \"S1903 | Median Income In The Past 12 Months (In 2010 Inflation-adjusted Dollars) - ACS 5-Year Estimates Subject Tables\" and \"B01003 | Total Population - 2010: ACS 5-Year Estimates Detailed Tables\". By changing the hyperlinks in our code, our simulation can run with different distributions; for example, those from different years. * Note: For the median income and population tables, the hyperlinks in the code won't be 'activated' until a request is made directly on the Census website - navigate to those links and use the 'Download' button for the appropriate graphs; no other action needed (Fix incoming)</p> <p>TIGER/Line Geodatabases shapefiles: </p> <p>Income distribution tables: </p> <p>Example of simulating a different geographic region [close-up of Atlanta beltline area]:  </p>"},{"location":"24fa-mponc/#project-status","title":"Project status","text":""},{"location":"24fa-mponc/#outputs-configuration","title":"Outputs &amp; configuration","text":"<p>Our code outputs a GIF to visualize agent behavior over time.

This combination is a novel combination of the strengths of LSTM's time series predictions and Kriging's spatial data dependencies.</p> <p>This team spent work cleaning up the open-source code from NUS to better understand the model's inputs. Having improved legibility, the adapatability of the model was clear to the team and allowed them to integrate campus-specific data. The team's work this semester was focused to replicate the NUS's model for Georgia Tech campus.

Comparative analysis with existing models and observations will help assess the reliability and identify potential areas for refinement, including:</p> <p>\u2022   Assessing the model's predictions across various time scales, such as hourly, daily, and seasonal trends, to identify performance consistency over short- and long-term periods. </p> <p>\u2022   Performing a detailed breakdown of prediction errors to uncover biases or patterns associated with specific weather variables (temperature, humidity, wind speed) and urban contexts.</p> <ol> <li>Handling Missing Data</li> </ol> <p>Addressing missing data in weather and spatial datasets remains a key challenge.
