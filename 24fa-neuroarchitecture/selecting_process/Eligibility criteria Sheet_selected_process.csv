Convenient transportation system may have positive mental 
health effects, such as reducing commuting stress, while 
others (e.g., high-density road networks) can have negative
 impacts, like increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Thus, 
when Transportation are analyzed as a whole, the conflicting
 effects may obscure the clarity of the conclusions.
